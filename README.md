## Business Understanding
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Business Objectives
> The company wants to understand the factors significant in the prediction of price of a house in the Australian market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house

## Data Understanding
> We are using house pricing data set. It contains the complete data of different factors on which the price of a house is calculated.
> We are also referring the data dictionary which describes the meaning of these variables.

> The aformentioned files are present inside this repository as:
1. train.csv
2. data_description.pdf (It contains the data dictionary)

## Project Information
